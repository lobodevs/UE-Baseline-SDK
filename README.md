# UE-Baseline-SDK
Generated SDK dumps from empty projects previously used for PDB generation
Dumper-7, UEVR (sdkgenny), and UE4SS dumps will be included for each project to provide comparisons of the popular SDK generators
I have actually read the EULA for Unreal Engine and I don't believe this is in any way a violation as no actual source code or implementation details are present but I will limit this to Epic Org members immediately if told otherwise.
